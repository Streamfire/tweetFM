# tweetFM
A ruby script for tweeting your latest scrobbles

## Requirements

* A Twitter and last.fm-account (obviously)
* Ruby 2.0+ (tested with 2.3.0)
* the following gems: yaml, rubygems, twitter, lastfm, oauth

## Usage

1. Run tweetFM.rb
2. Well, that's it. It's that simple.

## sidenotes

If you have problems, check whether or not the config.yml looks similar to the config.yml.example.
You still have problems? Shoot me a tweet @dasinking.

If you experience any crashes, please include the error message from the command line.

And no, I don't save any of your data. You use two applications of mine to access the API from Twitter and last.fm. I can't access any of your files, as the auth info is saved in your config.yml, so your precious memes are safe.

Also huge thanks to @nilsding for helping.
