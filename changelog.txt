		- cleaned up console outputs and added time

			- delete your config file before this update. you'll not need it anymore (thank fuck). a new one will be generated in the setup process. 
			- you don't need to create your own twitter app from now on, everything's running over my tweetFM-app per default. 
				- if you want to use your own (for whatever reason), just change the key+secret in lines 13+14
					- open source: where you can change things that make 0 difference, just because you can!
			- all hail the hypnotoad
		- script doesn't crash anymore with long song titles (character limit check now integrated)
		- more rescues to the rescue
		- option to credit me via the url field in your profile 
			- (would be very nice of you, because it's free, open source and stuff)
		- cleaned up the code a bit (oop style)
			- step by step i'm giving everything it's own function. welcome in the world of tomorrow!
		- added some comments (stfu @streamfire)
		- 280 characters are now supported
			- thanks to @nopejs for testing!
		- tl;dr: a much more stable tweetFM (hopefully) 
# v5:
		- you have to cryogenically freeze yourself to know the patch notes of the future, my friend
			- you can still push feature requests in the projects section on the repo
